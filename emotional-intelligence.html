  <h1>EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE!</h1>
  
  <p><b>What is Emotional Intelligence?</b></p>
<p>Emotional intelligence has to do with the ability to understand your own and other's emotions, and work with that information to make relationships and collaborations function.</p>



<p><b>How is it different to IQ?</b></p>

<p>As far as I'm aware, IQ (and potentially by extension EQ) is in many circles a discredited or at least problematic psychological concept. </p>
<p>But, if we take it at face value, IQ is the ability to think logically, and arguably more like a computer. I think binary thinking and binary concepts are much more of a tenet here with IQ than with EQ. IQ is important in website and software design for understanding cause and effect in a micro sense, i.e. visualising and fixing specific coding problems.</p>

<p>However, human relationships and introspective questionings are best thought about and understood with a different paradigm, EQ. EQ doesn't mathematically calculate how to conduct relationships, or how to understand yourself, it asks you to notice what you're feeling, and learn to read how others are feeling too. It's important to note that although EQ is conceptually more nebulous than IQ, it's still a skill that is able to be practiced and improved. </p>

<p><b>Why is it important?</b></p>
<p>Because the tech industry is currently structured around the needs of humans, and humans are working collaboratively in most facets of the industry. EQ is an important concept because it's tailor made to help humans genuinely and fulfillingly work with each other.</p>
