  <h1>PROBLEM SOLVING</h1>
  
  <p> 
    Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:
    </p>
    <p> 
    Got blocked on a simple problem:
    </p>
    <p> 
    What was the problem?
    </p>
    <p> 
    It's not specified whether this problem needs to be a coding one, so here's a time (which unfortunately isn't the only time) when for me the simple problem that I got blocked on was one of not being paid by a client who I'd invoiced.
    </p>
    <p> 
    What problem solving techniques did you use?
    </p>
    <p> 
    I used the technique of 'think about it every day but procrastinate actually following up with them for fear that they would find it rude or refuse to pay me'
    </p>
    <p> 
    How did you feel throughout the process?
    </p>
    <p> 
    Low level stress 24/7
    </p>
    <p> 
    What did you learn?
    </p>
    <p> 
    As soon as you send the followup message 99% of people will pay you right away. Also, if they don't, it's your prerogative to hit them up anyway, and is nothing to be ashamed of.
    </p>
    
    
    <p> 
    Now, here's when I solved a problem in an elegant way.
    </p>
    <p> 
    What was the problem?
    </p>
    <p> 
    The elegance of this is astounding – I solved 2 problems at once. Problem 1 – I had a giant van that I'd saved up a bunch of money for, that then proceeded to have all these nigh-on-unfixable problems  that left it rusting and mildewing in my driveway, serving zero purpose but to haunt me. The second problem was that I wanted to play the drums all the time, but there was nowhere to put a kit and the studio downtown cost $ per hour and I had to take public transport cause I wanted to get blasted on beers while I drummed so couldn't drive.
    </p>
    <p> 
    What problem solving techniques did you use?
    </p>
    <p> 
    I used the technique of combining! This is when you combine 2 seemingly disparate things to maximise the thing or solve a problem. Like I want my peanut butter to be more of a treat; and I want my chocolate to be more filling. It's like, the answer is right there dummy! Problems solved!
    </p>
    <p> 
    I also used the problem solving technique of letting something roll around the back of your head until it falls in to an It shaped hole. I feel like sleeping on problems and busying yourself with other things is good for the subconscious problem solving part of the brain. 
    </p>
    <p> 
    How did you feel throughout the process?
    </p>
    <p> 
    After I'd come up with the idea I was honestly so exhilarated, and it turned my experience of bung-van ownership from a haunting one to a fun one, where I felt like I wasn't neglecting it, and making the best of the situation. The drumming also improved my mental, physical and musical health and now I'm confident to play drums on my own records.
    </p>
    <p> 
    What did you learn?
    </p>
    <p> 
    That sometimes there are two problems in your life that when combined, can not only solve each other, but improve each other symbiotically.
    </p>
    <p> 
    Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem solving techniques/processes:
    </p>
    <p> 
    Pseudocode – this involves using clear language and isn't syntactically concrete like coding so I'm confident with it
    </p>
    <p> 
    Trying something – oof, this one I'm uncomfortable with at the start, then when I get momentum I'll try anything! 
    </p>
    <p> 
    Rubber ducky method – I record myself while I code and talk to myself heaps – I think this is adjacent to the Rubber Ducky Method, although the focussed nature or RDM is a unique thing that I'm missing. I think when I'm dealing with challenges that are more amorphous and unique to me in my future projects, it will be a dope tool. I am very confident with the idea of talking to an inanimate object.
    </p>
    <p> 
    Reading error messages – This one I'm getting better and better at, and the simplest versions of this skill have helped speed up my debugging heaps. Looking forward to learning more of the particulars but atm it's something I will at least attempt to decipher. There's so many helpful things tucked away in these programs! Esp git. 
    </p>
     <p> 
    Console.logging – I haven't used this nearly as much as maybe I should, but in a pinch I'm confident to type it and see if anything happens I can find helpful. Will probably do heaps more of this in the coming weeks. 
    </p>
    <p> 
    Googling – the holy grail of my problem solving skillset. 
    </p>
    <p> 
    Asking your peers for help – This is something I definitely need to improve on over Slack. In person I'm very confident to ask for help, but there's something about asking my peers over Slack that makes me feel very awkward – the combination of wanting to politely reply to everyone who jumps in to help is one barrier, another is that if I consider myself too far behind everyone else I'll be shy to make that known in the chat. This of course leads to me progressing even slower. I know two people in the cohorts and I am super comfortable asking them however, and have done so.
    </p>
    <p> 
    Asking coaches for help
    This one is all good, but since they're meant to be the final port of call after asking your peers on Slack, I find myself not taking advantage of it often. By coaches do you mean facilitators?
    </p>
    <p> 
    Improving your process with reflection
    I'm a keen diarist but need to focus more on making reflection at the end of every day a regular habit that I approach with attention to detail.
