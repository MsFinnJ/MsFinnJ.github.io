  <h1>Identity, Values </h1>

  <p>I did an online personality test (which I took with a large grain of salt) and used it to augment and direct some honest thinking about myself. I asked 2 people close to me to complete it too. I also looked to my original Dev Academy application where I did similar self-reflection.</p>
  
  <p><b>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</b></p>
    <p> One value that continues to arise in my reflection is that it's very important to me to do what I say I will, when I make a commitment to people. This has resulted in some long-term success in work, and has also made me quite good at not over-promising. 
  On the flipside however, in my less strong moments I tend to find loopholes in my responsibilities, and can push boundaries when I haven't specifically promised that I will do something. I especially tend to sacrifice my rest to stick to my goals. I feel like a promise or very clear commitment is something I hate to break and rarely do, but I'm good at weaseling around if I don't make that promise. </p>
  
  <p>Another value I hold is to be nonjudgemental. If I sense that I'm getting judgy on someone, I find it pretty easy to calm down and look at their situation with kindness.
  Once again on the flipside, this means that although I think I have a strong moral compass, when I'm dealing with someone who I think is behaving badly it's very hard for me to challenge them as my brain goes straight to trying to understand and de-escalate. 
  I think this intersects with my privilege, as I'm rarely affected directly by the behaviours and cultures that I care about challenging, i.e. white supremacy, patriarchy.</p>
   
  
  <p><b>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</b></p>
  
  <p>This one is a very modern ethical consideration – one of putting on live shows under COVID. </p>
  
  <p>On one hand I've been lucky, as the NZ government's response, while imperfect was one of the best in the world when it came to keeping the virus out of the country. This meant that throughout 2020/2021 it was easy to just comply with the rules to make sure everyone was an acceptable level of safe when I was organising and playing shows.</p>
  
  <p>That changed last month with Omicron. I was putting on a farewell show for myself (haha) as a celebration of my work at Radioactive.fm, there were 6 bands playing and we were hoping to at least have a couple hundred people in attendance. My face was on the poster and I was named as a co-producer of the show along with Active, so I was really the first port of call for any ethical decisions regarding the virus. I spent dozens of hours over about 4 months planning the show, and when we went into Red 6 days out, I had to think about whether I wanted to augment the show and push ahead, or cancel. </p>
  
  <p>The ethical questions involved were basically: People's safety, and the financial livelihood of the artists, workers and venue. My finances too, come to think of it, if that is an ethic. </p>
 <p> The first step to making a decision was understanding the implications of Omicron as a new strain of the virus. I go on Reddit a lot and so had seen what the US, Australia and Canada had to deal with over the previous weeks, and in my reading still tried to keep a clear head about the veracity of the info I was ingesting. It became clear that in this phase of the virus, governments are more and more leaning towards letting the virus run its course, even with high percentages of the population not having received a third vaccine shot, which is now widely considered to be 'fully vaxxed' for the moment. 
  The second step was to talk immediately to 2 trusted friends, one of which was playing the fest, and weigh up the options and look to each possible outcome. The next step was liaising with my boss at the radio and the venue owner, and finally the artists themselves. </p>
  
  <p>The decision I made was to cancel the show, give the artists an opportunity to organise a smaller, legal gig themselves, and help with the organisation/promo a little bit from a place of having handed over responsibility. That meant that their livelihood was as protected as much as I could control, and I wasn't culpable if the show became a spreading event. People were still going to go out, and venues were still going to put on shows that night, but ethically I didn't want to personally take the risk with people's health. </p>
  
  <p><b>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</b></p>
  
  <p>I grew up in a suburban, lower-middle class white family that valued self-expression, care and love but didn't have much interaction with their roots. This has made for somewhat of a vague identity in regards to my whakapapa, but a strong one in terms of my sense of self, as I was encouraged to fuck around and find out who I was, basically. My family is non-religious, has a lot of women in it and is pretty staunchly feminist idealogically. We are relatively tight-knit, and our 'culture' seems to only really hark back in any direct way to the 20th century. As a straight white person, I find the idea of culture elusive.</p>
  
  
  <p><b>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</b></p>
  
  <p>Strengths: </p>
  
  <p>Clear explanation of concepts
    <p>Fast learner and good at compartmentalising 
      <p>Able to describe express emotions and understand other's emotions
        <p>Very open minded 
          <p>Proactively kind</p>
  
  
  <p>Limitations:
    <p>Bad at self-discipline
      <p> Unsure how 'driven' I am
        <p>Unskilled at being a morning person 
          <p>Not confident in giving up creative control and trusting others to have a vision as cool as my own</p>
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <p><b>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</b></p>
  
  <p><b>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</b></p>
  
  <p>Strengths: </p>
  
  <p>Clear explanation of concepts – awesome for learning AND collaboration, to learn something means you can explain it in plain language</p>
  
  <p>Fast learner and good at compartmentalising – As far as I gather, the biggest roadblocks in coding come from not being able to see the tiniest iterations of the picture. </p>
  
  <p>Able to describe express emotions and understand other's emotions & very open minded – the challenge of engaging with diversity and equity as practiced concepts is working with people who have completely different experiences, ideas, and ways of being than you. A lot of the time people have trauma that informs their behaviour, which needs care and patience.</p>
  
  
  
  <p><b>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</b></p>
  
  <p>I started my first band right after a stint touring the country multiple times at 17 as part of a much older group. The band leader was what you'd call a 'benevolent dictator' and being impressionable, I ended up thinking this was the right/only way to do projects.  
  When I started my band, I didn't communicate my expectations around this, I just thought everyone ran a band in a pretty much non-collaborative way. That lead to me steamrolling people's ideas so I could be an auteur, and this eventually led to the drummer not showing up to a video shoot because he wasn't happy. 
  I didn't really learn my lesson in this regard for a while, 'cause 3 years later I put together a band of incredible, world class musicians but made them pretty much play what I told them to do, which while it ended up sounding pretty ok, was maybe 10% as good as it could have been. 
  A while after that, I got an offer from a bandmate in a different act to produce some of my stuff, and felt like it was my chance to do things differently. I held my tongue when he was trying out ideas, which was excruciating! But he'd always land on something awesome, and I developed my communication skills to tautoko him whilst getting my own ideas across creatively. This led to the release of my best song by all accounts, and a rich and continued collaborative relationship. I'd do things more like that these days, although I'm yet to face the challenge of working with someone who I don't immediately gel with creatively or have been grouped with without my input, so putting lots of effort into understanding their strengths seems like the right way forward. </p>
