  <h1>NEUROPLASTICITY AND GROWTH MINDSET</h1>
  
  <p> Research Neuroplasticity

    <p>  Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people
      <p> An understanding of neuroplasticity goes hand in hand with the benefits of understanding growth mindset â€“ that is, the more clear a picture you can have of how your brain actually physically operates, and what that means for your experience of the world as you live and learn, the more you will be able to use these phenomena to your advantage, as opposed to being bogged down with untrue concepts that hold you back.
    
      <p> Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit
      <p> Funnily enough, this week I moved to Auckland, so the next few months for me will see a huge amount of change in my neural pathways as I learn how to have this new life. I think to maximise this I could engage in daily journaling, which has the compounding effect of strengthening these new pathways that are being formed during the day. 
      
      <p> What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
      <p> Engage in a range of tasks and skills that are unfamiliar to you. 
      
      <p> Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.

      <p> Research Growth Mindset
    
    <p> Discuss what it is and why it is relevant
    <p> Growth mindset is essentially the philosophy of how to best learn and conceptualise skills, and how to grow emotionally and critically as a person. It's based on our new knowledge of neuroplasticity. Basically, the idea is that our brains can get better at pretty much any skill, as opposed to the idea that everyone has a natural amount of talent for each thing in life, and that talent is fixed, and no amount of effort on our part can change this. 
    It's relevant because what we're learning in Dev Academy is difficult, complex, multi-faceted and conceptual; i.e. it requires a different kind of thinking than we usually use in our lives, and the kind of skills that you hear people say 'I'm not a natural at this' about.  
    
    
    <p> In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
    <p> As an ex-teacher, it was all pretty ingrained for me already! It is just nice to have it reinforced and to make sure I'm still applying these concepts to my own journey! 
    
    <p> How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
    <p> I have been taking videos of my studying, so to go back and see me struggling with something that I was doubtful I could ever get correct will reinforce the benefits of a growth mindset.
