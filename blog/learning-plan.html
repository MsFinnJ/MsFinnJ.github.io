What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
I am aiming for a career in game design, the ideal pathway for me is starting my own development studio and directing games, or taking a 'solo developer' route.

A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning


Strengths: 

Clear explanation of concepts
Fast learner and good at compartmentalising 
Able to describe and express emotions, and understand other's emotions
Very open minded 
Proactively kind

Limitations:

Bad at self-discipline
Unsure how 'driven' I am
Unskilled at being a morning person 
Not confident in giving up creative control and trusting others to have a vision as cool as my own

What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?

I want to learn how to work with people where we have the same amount of passion and vision, and there isn't a clear heirarchy, it's more 'pure' collaboration. I swear there is a word for this. But I think the fact that I don't know that word proves that it's a skill I have yet to learn lol.

A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:

An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives 
I will manage this by actively communicating through all parts of the course, online and offline, when there is something that needs to be communicated. I will always keep an ear out to see if anyone is struggling or in need of a debrief/chill. I'm aware that so much of this course is interpersonal, not to mention how intensive it is, so I think this is a good priority to have. This kaupapa applies to my interactions with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.

What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
I recently purchased an electric drum kit – this is gonna be awesome for staying grounded and pounding out my frustrations when I'm at home. 
It's not something I have much experience with, but if I get really frustrated at the bootcamp, I'll talk about it non-judgementally and take some time to calm down, smash a guided mindfulness meditation, get some advice.  

A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
I will message my facilitators as soon as it looks as though I might need help completing my overarching goals at Dev Academy.


A description of what you expect from the facilitation team
I expect proactive communication, respect, honesty, hopefully enthusiasm but I can't demand that lol, just what you've been doing so far is great. 
I expect you to do as right by me, as you do by everyone in the cohort.

Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
Every 2nd Friday I feature on RNZ, talking about my favourite new songs. This takes around 4-5 hours to research and compile, then the recording takes 30mins on the Friday evening at 7:30.
All this work is pretty malleable, time wise.
