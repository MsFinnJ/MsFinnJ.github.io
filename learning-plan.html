  <h1>Finn Johansson: Learning Plan</h1>
  <p><b>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</b>
    I am aiming for a career in game design, the ideal pathway for me is starting my own development studio and directing games, or taking a 'solo developer' route.</p>
    
    <p><b>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</b></p>
    
    
    <p><i>Strengths:</i></p>
    
    <p>Clear explanation of concepts
    Fast learner and good at compartmentalising 
    Able to describe and express emotions, and understand other's emotions
    Very open minded 
    Proactively kind</p>
    
    <p><i>Limitations:</i></p>
    
    <p>Bad at self-discipline
    Unsure how 'driven' I am
    Unskilled at being a morning person 
    Not confident in giving up creative control and trusting others to have a vision as cool as my own</p>
    
    <p><b>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</b></p>
    
    <p>I want to learn how to work with people where we have the same amount of passion and vision, and there isn't a clear heirarchy, it's more 'pure' collaboration. I swear there is a word for this. But I think the fact that I don't know that word proves that it's a skill I have yet to learn lol.</p>
    
    <p><b>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</b></p>
    
    <p><b>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives </b></p>
    I will manage this by actively communicating through all parts of the course, online and offline, when there is something that needs to be communicated. I will always keep an ear out to see if anyone is struggling or in need of a debrief/chill. I'm aware that so much of this course is interpersonal, not to mention how intensive it is, so I think this is a good priority to have. This kaupapa applies to my interactions with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</p>
    
    <p><b>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</b>
    I recently purchased an electric drum kit – this is gonna be awesome for staying grounded and pounding out my frustrations when I'm at home. 
    It's not something I have much experience with, but if I get really frustrated at the bootcamp, I'll talk about it non-judgementally and take some time to calm down, smash a guided mindfulness meditation, get some advice.  
    
    <p><b>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</b></p>
    <p>I will message my facilitators as soon as it looks as though I might need help completing my overarching goals at Dev Academy.</p>
    
    
    <p><b>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</b>
    <p>I expect proactive communication, respect, honesty, hopefully enthusiasm but I can't demand that lol, just what you've been doing so far is great. 
    I expect you to do as right by me, as you do by everyone in the cohort.</p>
    
    <p><b>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</b></p>
    <p>Every 2nd Friday I feature on RNZ, talking about my favourite new songs. This takes around 4-5 hours to research and compile, then the recording takes 30mins on the Friday evening at 7:30.
    All this work is pretty malleable, time wise.</p>
