  <h1>CORE REFLECTION</h1>
  
  <p> <b>
    What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
  </b> </p>
    <p>
    I have learned that that I do have an ego around being seen to be uniquely excellent, and to feel that way. I feel like all that does is slow things down. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I learned that my ego can be sorta transmuted into something empowering.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    One thing that I learned about myself is that actively using the word 'yet' when talking about how you can't do things works way better than just agreeing in theory that it would work to do that.
    </p>
    
    
    <p><b>
    What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?
    </b></p>
    
    <p>
    In learning, values help a teacher think about how to treat their students well, and help a student think about how to apply what they've learned well. I made that intentionally vague, because values is a pretty vague word. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In programming, values create a framework for large amounts of people to adhere to a shared ethical standard in their collaborative work.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In learning, empathy is important for everyone involved, but the onus is on the teacher to take the empathetic lead and put themselves in the shoes of someone at a completely different level of understanding and skill than they are. 
    In a kind of interesting way, empathy with a teacher is important for students cause it helps them visualise themselves becoming as skilled as the teacher, and to believe that it's possible.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The success of almost any goal that we have in programming is deeply beholden to empathy, even outside of interpersonal interactions. 
    All hardware and software exists for the fundamental purpose of solving problems and meeting needs that people have. A fundamental similarity that many of those problems and needs have (the non-food and shelter ones) is that people want to understand others and feel understood. I feel like empathy can even extend to UI design, because don't you just feel SEEN by a menu that does exactly what you think it will and want it to!?
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In teaching, both the teacher and the student are focussed primarily on the student, so self awareness on the student's part is hugely important. Being able to assess both their progress over time, as well as their moment to moment physical and mental goings-on will lead to the student actually controlling the learning that is happening to them. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
    People in programming are always learning, so I'd say self-awareness carries through in the same ways as it does for a student. In addition, social awareness and knowing your foibles and strengths and approaching them without an overbearing ego is essential for collaborative work.
    </p>
    
    <p><b>
    What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
    </b></p>
    <p>
    I'm surprised that I thought that having meditated a lot in the past meant I didn't have to really meditate much over foundations. 
    What I'm saying is, I'm looking forward to doing it with everyone daily, for accountability's sake.
    </p>
    
    <p><b>
    What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
    </b></p>
    <p>
    Approaching them humbly, with a beginner's mind. Talking to Garrett on the phone. He was great, I just get nervous on the phone sometimes.
    </p>
    
    <p><b>
    Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
    </b></p>
    
    <p>
    To fill a need for employers, as heaps of people are realising/have realised that it pays off to bank hard on potential employees with amazing 'soft skills'. 
    This is for all the reasons I touched on above re: values, empathy and self-awareness. Just replace those words with 'core'.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    A less capitalistically minded reason I think you have for focussing on teaching these skills is that they genuinely and deeply help the lives of everyone who learns them, and everyone who those people end up coming into contact with. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Earnestly approaching these skill sets and making them part of the curriculum is a strong thing to do and I tautoko it. 
    </p>
    
    <p><b>
    Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
    </b></p>
    
    <p>
    Hell no it doesn't, tech learning is a waste of time without core learning and I think my previous answers serve as adequate justification. 
    </p>
