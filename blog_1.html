  <h3 class="red-background thin-green-border" > <p> Hello 

    <p> Sprint 1 Command Line Reflection 
    
    
    <p> In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it? 
    a way of using your computer by writing words instead of clicking things
    Analogy:
    it's like opening up the bonnet of your car and driving it from there - it takes more skill but you have more control. This is a shit analogy haha
    
    
    <p> Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?
    a little on the long side, sorry! Still ironing out my process. I think this is a great reflection question.
    
    
    <p> Name 5 commands you used and what they do.
    
    cd - change directory - navigate between folders (directories)
    
    ls - show the contents of the current directory
    
    pwd - show the path of the current directory
    
    touch - create a file 
    
    . 
    current folder
    
    .. 
    parent folder
    
    
    <p> VERSION CONTROL WITH GIT 
    
    
    
    <p> Did you learn anything unexpected?
    
    
    I was surprised by how fast the terminal can communicate with the os, it feels like it cuts out a lot of unneeded processing
    
    
    
    <p> In your reflections, answer the following questions:
    
    <p> Whats the difference between Git and GitHub?
    git is the software/code that when used, means multiple people (in a team, for example) can collaborate on the same code without overwriting each other's work. Git has flexible parameters for how these edits interact with each other. 
    
    Github is a service which acts as a third party host for people using Git to collaborate on code. This means users can work together remotely, and it has social network elements where people can follow each other and upload/share their coding projects. 
    
    <p> Can you think of an analogy to describe them?
    git is Elton John and Bernie Taupin writing songs together. Github is them doing it over the phone - but they're both talking to an operator? And the operator has a bunch of notes they're keeping track of and feeding and receiving and compiling different versions of verses and choruses etc into the one song.
    
    <p> Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?
    Yes
    Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?
    More or less 
    
    
    <p> What is a GitHub work flow?
    I don't know, but I imagine it's the typical habits you'll build when making projects in Git
    Edit 5/2/21 ohh it's the etiquitte and process of cloning (maybe forking) and pulling and branching altering and pushing and getting people to do pull requests.
    
    <p> What did you notice about your own learning? 
    If I read out Loud everything went smoother
    
    <p> What did you do when you were confused or blocked?
    Slowly read out loud everything again, google stuff, consider asking cohort mates
    
    <p> Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?
    Probably just shorter breaks, but just as frequent 
    
    <p> How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?
    Each piece of work you do in git is like a bullet in a gun. The bullet has to be chambered (staged) before it can be fired (committed)
    
    <p> What is main?
    The canonical, hopefully perfectly working version of the project 
    
    <p> Why create a branch?
    To either fix a bug, or introduce a new feature without worrying about messing up the main project
    
    Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?
    Intuitive
    <p> GitHub Fork & Clone
    
    <!-- Answer the following questions -->
    
    <p><p><p> What are some examples of when you would fork?
    if you were in a large team or an open source project, you would fork and clone a repo to have your very own copy you can mess with, sort of like a branch but with the whole repo 
    
    
    
    <p><p><p> Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?
    It was all pretty smooth understanding for me, leading on from some earlier click moments
    
    
    <p> Setup Repo & Create Blog
    
    <p><p><p> Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?
    I don't think I really did - maybe when the blog didn't load up straight away but then I saw it takes upwards of 15 mins to show. 
    EDIT on Sat 4 Feb - It turns out there was a problem, but there was only one change that needed to be made.
    No feelings of frustration to report... YET
    
    <p><p><p> If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made; was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?
    I didn't know at all how that happened, what did I picture? I pictured different websites talking to each other to make a website? So I guess I knew there were different programs involved. The most surprising part is how much sense it makes, I guess? Ohohoho but I'd been directed to GitHub in the past with mods and stuff, and holy hell did I not know what was going on or how to use it at all. 
    
    
    
    
    
    <p> Thinking like a programmer
    
    <p><p><p> What is your process so far for solving problems?
    Take it slow, simplify/compartmentalise, make an overview of what needs to be done and separate all the things into categories (if this is a big task I'll use Trello), if my concentration or motivation is low, I'll livestream myself doing it for accountability lol and talk out the problem with the camera. If I get stuck I'll go for a walk or have a drum, then come back. 
    Flipped learning wise, I haven't been in a position where I've had a teacher in a long time, so I don't have experience with it or a flipped classroom, but I feel as though I understand the basics of the concept.
    
    
    
    
    <p> Introduce yourself
    
    <p><p><p> What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? 
    Very ok and fine. It took a bit of fanangling to get the right vibe across, but I find that process satisfying.
    
    
    <p><p><p> Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious? 
    I wasn't self conscious. If I did feel my ego, it was in regards to not really wanting to self-promote, as so far in my life I've done a lot of summarising myself to a group of strangers in the form of press releases and promo for my music, networking, radio etc. For dev academy, I'm looking forward to more of an interpersonal dynamic, and to learning about everyone else through their blogs!
