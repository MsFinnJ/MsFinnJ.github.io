  <h1>TECHNICAL BLOG - PADDING, BORDER AND MARGIN</h1>
  <p>In this short technical blog, I'm going to explain the CSS concepts of PADDING, BORDER and MARGIN using a comparison most of us can easily understand â€“ hanging paintings on a wall.
    I'll also be showing what the basic code looks like to manipulate these 3 properties.</p>
    
    <p>So here you are! Begin the metaphor! </p>
    
    <p>You have a <i>blank wall</i>.
    That is your <b>WEBPAGE</b>.</p>
    
    <p>You have <i>paintings</i> you want to put on the wall. 
    That is your <b>CONTENT</b>. <b>CONTENT</b> on a WEBPAGE is the words, the ideas, the pictures, the videos the things that someone would come to a website wanting to ingest. </p>
     
    <p>Also, you are a master <i>frame</i> maker and you can make <i>frames</i> of any thickness to hang your <i>paintings</i> in.
    This is your <b>BORDER</b>.</p>
    
    <p>Let's start by seeing how we can change the properties of our <b>BORDER</b>, then we can explain <b>PADDING</b> and <b>MARGIN.</b></p>
    
    <p>Three common properties for a <b>BORDER</b> are Width, Colour and Style.
    Here's two <b>BORDERs</b>, one with a 5 pixel wide, green, solid <b>BORDER</b>, the other one with a doubly wide (10px), red, dotted <b>BORDER</b>.</p>
    
   <img src="images/BORDER 5.png"> <img src="images/BORDER 5 im.png">
    
   <img src="images/BORDER 10.png"> <img src="images/BORDER 10 im.png">
    
    <p>Next, let's learn about <b>PADDING</b>. This is the distance between your <b>CONTENT</b> (the <i>painting</i>) and the <b>BORDER</b>.
    Here's 2 sizes of <b>PADDING</b>, the first is 15 pixels in size, the second is 30.
    (Note that the <b>CONTENT</b> is aligned to the left by default.)</p>
    
   <img src="images/PADDING 15.png"> <img src="images/PADDING 15 im.png">

   <img src="images/PADDING 30.png"> <img src="images/PADDING 30 im.png">
    
    
    <p>Finally, the <b>MARGIN</b> denotes the amount of empty space outside the BORDER. This is the distance you choose to hang your <i>paintings</i> apart. You can think of the <b>MARGIN</b> as the amount of personal space each <i>painting</i> has.
    In this example the <b>MARGIN</b> properties of the top box are being changed. The first is 20 pixels in size, the second is 40. (Note that increasing the <b>MARGIN</b> distance effects the distance from the edge of the page, as well as other <b>CONTENT</b> on the page.)</p>
    
   <img src="images/MARGIN 20.png"> <img src="images/MARGIN 20 im.png">

   <img src="images/MARGIN 40.png"> <img src="images/MARGIN 40 im.png">
    
    <p>Did this make sense? Are you a master painting hanger now? Are you the benevolent god of your metaphorical wall?</p>
    
    <p>Thanks for reading ;)</p>
