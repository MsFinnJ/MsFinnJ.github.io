  <h1>JavaScript and THE DOM!</h1>
  




<p>Hi! And welcome to a little friend-to-friend chat about Javascript.

    <p>As you may know, Javascript is one of 3 different languages that are interacting with each other when you're looking at a webpage. The other two are HTML and CSS. 
    
    <p>A website is like a politician. 
    
    <p>They're trying to convince you of something, and the content of that something is called HTML. But without CSS they're standing nude up there on the podium! Ridiculous, not to mention embarassing for them. CSS is like the clothes they'd be wearing while they're doing their speech, the hair gel they have on, as well as the fancy fonts and colours on their powerpoint slides. It all adds to the convincingness of the content they're delivering in their speech.
    
    <p>When you run HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you're essentially giving the politician a series of instructions through their little ear piece. These will be followed TO THE LETTER, and executed in a precise order. For example:
    
    <p>Turn to the right
    <p>Walk on to the stage
    <p>Deliver Speech
    
    
    <p>The rules about the order these orders are executed in is called Control Flow.
    
    <p>Loops are used when this politican needs to do things like brush their teeth. It consists of a little rule that gets repeated until it's done (i.e. the act of brushing back and forth). You get to decide what the rule is, and the rules about when the rule has finished repeating.
    
    <p>Oops, I was not meant to use brushing teeth as an example. It's actually a lot more like this politician is at a meet and greet, greeting every person with the same script until all the people have been met and gret. In this case, the loop can be programmed to finish when there's no more people left to greet. 
    
    <p>The DOM stands for Document Object Model and is the way JavaScript reads and interacts with HTML and CSS on a webpage. It visualises it as a branching tree of sections. You can then use Javascript to get, change, add, or delete HTML and CSS elements within these sections on your web browser using developer tools.
    
    <p>Here are 2 ways of accessing data: Through arrays, and through objects. The difference between the two is that arrays pluck things from a list of data, and objects just refer to one thing.
    
    <p>Functions are a way of storing code so that it can get executed in one go, and giving that block of code a short name and making it easily useable. They're useful for making a template of what to do in a given situation, and using it in multiple places without having to copy and paste big blocks of code everywhere. For example, we want our politician to brush their teeth twice a day. If we encode this behaviour to a function, then we can tell them to do it any time we want, and they'll do it identically every time. 
    
    <p>Thank you for coming to the Model UN!
